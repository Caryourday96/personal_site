## Advertising identifiers and current state

Game ads remain disabled. The European consent builder contains unsaved settings; no message is published. The Azure workflow currently enforces ADS_ENABLED=false and ADS_CONSENT_READY=false. Root hosting is now authorized for separate static sites, superseding the earlier instruction to wait for a hosting destination; it does not authorize replacing the root with the game interface.
